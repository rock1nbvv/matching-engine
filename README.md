## Coding:
Implement a matching engine.
They give you a skeleton code and some unit tests that you should pass as many of them as possible.
Don’t remember all the missing parts but in the skeleton code you need to fill “add order”, “delete order”,
logic for a trade, consider the cases where a trade can take partial or multiple levels, ...

What data structure should be used to maintain order queue sorted by price and time priority?

How the order matching is happening?

## DS:
Dynamic Array, Linked List, Hash Table, Binary Heap, Binary Search Tree, Queue

## elaborate a way to distinguish between 1 byte and two bytes encoded characters and delete the character from the text file.
1 11
## how many bits do you need to encode 1000 characters alphabet?
10
## Given a binary tree, a node is visible if the value it holds is no greater than all the values along the path from the root. Write pseudo-code for an efficient algorithm to find the number of visible nodes in this tree.

## In the Java specification, it is considered good practice to override .equals() and .hashCode() both together. In the context of HashMap, explain why implementing only one of the two instead of both can cause problems. You must consider both cases.
